This is the Code Book for the run_analysis.R program

Requires: dplyr, tidyr packages

VARIABLES:

anames - data frame containing the number and name of each activity
all.names - vector that contains the file paths for the 28 original text files extracted from 'UCI HAR Dataset.zip'
avg.data - tidy data set containing the average of each measurement type for each activity and volunteer
cnames - descriptive labels used to name each measurement type variable
dat1 - temporary data set used to create the test.data and train.data set
dat2 - temporary data set used to create the test.data and train.data set
dat3 - temporary data set used to create the test.data and train.data set
data - the data set containing the merged training and test data
keep - logical vector that identifies measurement type that is a mean or standard deviation
measurements - gives the column numbers of the measurement typ variable to keep in the final data set
mnames - data frame containing the number and name of each measurement type
td - temporary directory script
test.data - data set that contains the volunteer, activity, and measurements for each test
train.data - data set that contains the volunteer, activity, and measurements for each training test

DATA:

Input:

File paths for the text files referenced in run_analysis.R
./temp/UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt                    
./temp/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt  
./temp/UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt                
./temp/UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt                 
./temp/UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt 	
./temp/UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt                    
./temp/UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt                   
./temp/UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt 

output:
tidy_data_set.txt - output file of avg.data

STEPS:
1) read.table - command used to open the saved text files
2) cbind, rbind - commands used to combine individual data sets into a merged data set
3) select - command used to reduce the merged dataset to mean and standard deviation variables
4) factor - command used to transform activities from numeric to descriptive
5) gsub - command used to edit variable names and make them more readable
6) grepl - command used to locate variable names containing "mean" and "std"
7) gather - command used to create a tidy data set, reducing the number of columns
8) group_by - command used to group the data set
9) arrange - command used to sort the data set by volunteer, activity, and measurement type
10) summarise - command used to calculate the average value of each measurement type by volunteer and activity
